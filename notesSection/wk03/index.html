       <h3>1. Content Prioritization</h3>
       <p>Less is more. Display only essential content. Secondary content should be available via menu and menu should be hierarchy based. 
        Use icons instead of text where possible.</p>
       <h3>2. Make Navigation intuitive</h3>
       <p>Pathways for navigation should be clear to the user. Don't make users navigate between apps and pages for a single task.</p>
       <h3>3. Touchscreen Target Sizes</h3>
       <p>Make interfaces big enough for finger interaction. Apple's suggested minimum is 44px X 44px, Microsoft recommends 9mm/34px.
        Spacing in between is important as well, especially when it comes to contradicting action buttons. Include an undo button if possible. </p>
       <h3>4. Provide User Control</h3>
       <p>Allow for user personalization. ie..changing settings, controlling notifications, canceling actions. Inform the user of actions
        where possible. Allow for demos (guest sign in) before commitment.</p>
       <h3>5. Legible Text Content</h3>
       <p>"The key to mobile typography is readability." Smaller than 16px becomes difficult to read. Overly large can cause awkward breaks in the page.
        30-40 characters per line for mobile screens. Adding space between text can keep users from being overwhelmed.
       </p>
       <h3>6. Make Interface Elements clearly visible</h3>
       <p>Contrast between background and elements should be enough to maintain visibility in all different surroundings. Test it out to make sure.

       <h3>7. Hand position controls</h3>
       <p><a href="https://uxbert.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/06-1024x768.png" target="_blank">photo referance</a> <br> 49% of people rely on one thumb to navigate phone.
       common features should be placed in easy to reach quadrents. Keep in mind ALL different kinds of users.</p>
       <h3>8. Minimize Data Input</h3>
       <p>Minimize typeing with use of 'remember me' options, drop downs, location detection, auto-complete, etc. Display keyboard variations
        based on what info is needed. (number pad for phone number etc.)
       </p>
       <h3>9. Create a seamless experience</h3>
       <p>Reduce friction, minimize steps, and make use of devices' features. The experiance should flow between all differnt devices/screens. Sync 
        information across devices as well. Communication with users should be part of this.
       </p>
       <h3>10. Test Your Design</h3>
       <p>"Test early. Test often." Build projects with a user centered approach. The earlier you discover problems the quicker and easier it can be to fix them.</p>

             <p class="infoBox">API real-world example...."think about the electricity supply in your house, apartment, or other dwellings. 
               If you want to use an appliance in your house, you plug it into a plug socket and it works. You don't try to 
               wire it directly into the power supply â€” to do so would be really inefficient and, if you are not an electrician, 
               difficult and dangerous to attempt." The plug is the API.</p>
