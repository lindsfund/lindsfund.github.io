      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
        <p>I have met with my group multiple times to go over the material for this week and last week. I have also spent time on my own looking for
           knowledge I might be missing to help with the add to cart button issue. I have done the readings for this week and added functionality to my notes page based on those readings. 
          I started a tutorial section on my notes page with the completed tutorial.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
      <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
        <p>I will do the readings for next week and add the functionality practice to my notes page. I will also find another tutorial to run through on my own and add that to the notes page as well.
          I feel like I am missing information that is needed for this course and so I will start with tutorials on the subjects that were mentioned as necessary from Bro. Baer. I will also meet
          with my group on Monday to go over the group assignment for this week and we will probably meet again later in the week as well.
        </p>

      <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
        <p>Just with my group I have spent almost 8hrs this week trying to find the solution to the add to cart button. This is my major blocker this week. I feel that I am missing some sort of knowledge that is 
          very specific to this project because I was able to build a dynamic page and have the cart work on that. I've discovered that editing someone else's code is a very complex and difficult process.
