      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
        <p>Since the last meeting I have gained a better understanding of 'this', the class syntax, and the 
          import/export module. I have taken notes on these subjects and coded them into my notes page for further 
          practice. I have also joined and met with my team. We looked at and worked on the team projects together.

      <div class="question">
      <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
        <p>Next I will look over the articles advised for design principles, web APIs, and scheduling(setTimeout/setInterval). I will most likely need to 
          look further into these articles and take notes to fully understand the concepts. I will then use some of the learned concepts in adding the notes to 
          my git page. I also have a meeting scheduled with my team on Tuesday and during that meeting we will go over the team assignment for next week.

        <div class="question">
      <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
        <p>Currently, my main blockers are time and scheduling. It has been 2 years since I completed WDD230 and I find that I am needing to review many of the 
          concepts that are assumed known in this class. That is eating up a lot of my time, but will hopefully not be an issue for much longer. Scheduling meetings
          and finding my team was also time-consuming and coordinating schedules is always complicated. Our initial meeting was later in the week than I would have 
          liked, and so it put me behind in my work. We have scheduled our meeting earlier in the week this time in an attempt to give ourselves more time to complete 
          the assignments. However, we have chosen to use Zoom for our meetings and the time limit for the meetings there might prove problematic.
