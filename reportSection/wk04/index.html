      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
        <p>I have met with my team twice to go over the team assignment for this week. We have gone through the site both together and on our own to complete it. 
          I have also done the readings, taken notes, and posted the notes to my page. In addition to the assigned reading and notes I have consulted online tutorials 
          in order to gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript. Those have been posted to my github pages as well. 
        </p>

      <div class="question">
      <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
        <p>On Monday, I will review the team assignment to prepare for our team meeting on Tuesday. I will use my time the rest of the week to complete the readings and at least 3 of the 
          tutorials on the JavaScript 30 site. All of the notes will be accessible and functioning on my github page.
        </p>

        <div class="question">
      <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
        <p>I am rusty in my JavaScript and so I am taking longer than planned to complete assignments. Also, in my team we are getting comfortable enough 
          with each other that we are being social. This is overall a good thing however, it makes our meetings longer and less productive.
